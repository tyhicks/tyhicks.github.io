Hello! My name is Tyler Hicks and I live in Dallas, TX. I've been involved with
the Linux kernel and Linux security since 2007. I am currently working at
Microsoft's Linux Systems Group while maintaining the Microsoft Linux kernel
for various products. Past roles include time at Canonical performing security
response and proactive hardening on the Ubuntu Kernel Team and leading the
Ubuntu Security Team. Before Canonical, I was part of the Security Team at
IBM's Linux Technology Center.

Some of my day-to-day duties include:
- [Windows Subsytem for Linux 2 (WSL2) kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel) maintainer
- [AppArmor](https://apparmor.net/) development
- [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) Core Dev
- [eCryptfs](ecryptfs.org) kernel maintainer

I try to keep myself busy with hobbies in personal time. They include
attempting to woodwork, turning wrenches on vintage cars, home improvement
projects, and travel.

You can learn more about me, contact me, and even take a look at what I've been
