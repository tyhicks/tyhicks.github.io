Hello! My name is Tyler Hicks and I live in Dallas, TX. I've been involved with
Linux security since 2007 and am currently the Ubuntu Security Technical Lead.
My day-to-day duties include
[AppArmor](http://wiki.apparmor.net/index.php/Main_Page) development,
[eCryptfs](ecryptfs.org) maintainer, and producing
[features](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features) and
[security updates](https://usn.ubuntu.com) for the
[Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) Linux distribution.

When I'm not trying to improve the security of Ubuntu systems, I try to keep
myself busy with hobbies. That includes attempting to woodwork, turning
wrenches on vintage cars, home improvement projects, and travel.

You can learn more about me, contact me, and even take a look at what I've been
working on by following these links:
